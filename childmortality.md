# Critique By Design - MakeoverMonday

This project explores the critique by design technique to improve an existing data viz and unearth the story that lies within.

## Design Process
### Explore - Finding a viz with a hidden story
Step one of the project was finding a data viz on the Makeovermondays website. For me, this viz had to be a blend of three things - a topic I'm passionate about, built upon a complex dataset, and something that could benefit from a revamp. Essentially, it had to be a story worth sharing with the world.

### Examine - Actionable Critique
It's easy to critique, but much harder to improve. This is why in step two, I began to deconstuct and dissect the chosen viz using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. This critical analysis helped me identify the pros and cons of the current viz; what's working, what isn't and most importantly - WHY! Next, I built simple pen-to-paper sketches to see how things could be done differently. At this stage, it was low fidelity execution, high fidelity critical thinking! 

### Evaluate - Relooking at the data, with an external lens
I think data is a language, and languages are a medium of communication. Visualizations don't exist in silos. They are meant to synchronize minds and hearts. This is why, user research was critical to evaluate the sketches and prototypes I built. I conducted semi-structured interviews with five different participants where they engaged with my versions of the viz. I then synthesized user feedback to draw insights and go back to the drawing board.

### Elevate - Re-telling the story
Finally, it was time for high fidelity execution and pixel perfection! It was time to showcase the story I unearthed from the previous viz and present it in a new light!

## Let's dive into Each of these steps!

## EXPLORE
From the MakeoverMonday website, I picked the 'Child and Infant Mortality' data viz produced in September 2024 by 'Our World in Data'.

This viz fit my criteria perfectly - it presented healthcare related information (something I'm passionate about), it was built upon a complex data set (per capita GDPs of all nearly all the countries in the world, respective child mortality rates and populations across the years of 1950 to 2022) and lastly it was something that could benefit from a revamp. Child mortality is a crucial issue in today's world as income and health inquity rises across the globe. Currently, the viz did not produce an instant aha! moment or even give an at-a-glance insight to someone who looks at it. This is where I began to......

## EXAMINE
Using Stephen Few's Visualization Effectiveness profile, I dissected the viz and ranked it across the following key parameters - 
### Informative Parameters - Usefulness, Completeness, Perceptibility, Truthfulness, Intuitiveness
### Emotive Parameters - Aesthetics, Engagement

Here's a sneak peak into my critique!
