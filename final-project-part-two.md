# Part II 

## Wireframes / Storyboards
> I used a combination of Figma and Shorthand to put the storyboard/wireframes together and some Tableau experimentation to create the data vizs. I started off by creating static visuals in Figma in order to keep the focus on the narrative and refien the persuasive appeal of the story arc. The goal was to not get distracted by animations, transitions and other additions which could be integrated later. Below is a work in progress Shorthand draft of the storyboard.

## User research 

### Target audience
> Since my target audience is from the 40-55+ age group, I had to get innovative to find representative users. I contacted some of my family members who are in that age bracket and have lived in the USA for more than two decades. I also leveraged my friend's network and family to identify participants. These weren't exactly from the same socio economic background as my target audience, but I could test my storyboard for general comprehension, appeal and perceived impact.

I identified three participants, as mentioned below. The goal was to cover the broad age spectrum. I also tried to engage in informal conversation before the interviews to identify their general awareness about the impact of home modifications/home improvement. Based on my understanding, I marked them as having beginner, intermediate and advanced levels of awareness. I tried to estimate this level of awareness and didn't ask any explicit questions about it in order to avoid biasing them about my story.

| Initials | Age | Awareness about Home Mods |
|------|----------|-----------------------------------|
|  BS  |     55 years     |     Beginner     |
|  AA  |      40 years    |     Intermediate     |
|  AS    |    58 years      |     Advanced     |


### Interview script
> Research Goal: Understanding the extent to which the story can appeal to the user and push them to introspect about getting a holistic home mod evaluation.    
> I wanted to gather raw, unfiltered reactions from my participants and therefore, I decided to conceal the fact that the storyboard was my own creation.

Below is an overview of my interview protocol.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  Understanding first impressions    | As you went through the storyboard, what thoughts came to your mind?                 |
|   Evaluating visual language    | What do you think about the colors and visuals used in the storyboard? Did the images speak to you? Did you like or dislike a particular visual?                 |
|   Assessing clarity of CTA    | Intuitively, what next step would you take after viewing this story? How did the ending of the story make you feel?                 |
|   Measuring viz comprehension   | Can you walk me thhrough your understanding of the data vizualizations? What did you like/dislike about them? Was there anything that stuck with you?               |
|   Assessing legibility    |  Was all the text legible? Did you have trouble reading or comprehending any particular section?                |

## Moodboards / personas
> Since my story was anchored to one of my internship projects, I largely borrowed the color palette from the comapny's brand guidelines. However, I did make some small tweaks in the moodboard to reflect the tone of voice of my storytelling. I used a balanced and cool color palette to appeal to the mature sensibilities of my audience (40 - 55 year olds), and used the blues and greens to evoke a sense of trust, reliability and credibility. The visual language and imagery is meant to be slightly metaphorical, since I wanted to avoid showing any explicit images of falls, accidents, and other mishaps. I had to walk a thin line to get the message across without throwing off my audience. Or rather, I didn't want to use negative imagery that would evoke strong emotional reactions, as a threat or bait. 

Here's the moodboard I created for my story.

I decided to refine my user persona/archetype since Part I, and made it more concise to retain the most important things I need to remember while I design for them.  

> ### Proactive Planner    
> 45-55 years old, Low to middle income ($40k-$80k annually)       
Occupation: Skilled trades, clerical work, or other mid-level careers nearing retirement    
Family: Likely has grown or nearly grown children, may also be caring for aging parents     
Home Ownership: Majority are homeowners, with properties that may be 20+ years old and in need of renovation or modification     
> Motivations: As they approach retirement age, they are motivated by the desire to live comfortably in their homes for as long as possible. They are looking for ways to safeguard their health and independence while managing the financial aspect of home improvements on a budget.    
> Pain Points: They are aware of the rising costs of healthcare and assisted living    
> Barriers: While concerned about future risks, they may lack awareness of available home modifications or feel overwhelmed by the costs associated with such improvements. They may also be unsure about how to begin the process or who to trust for the work.
