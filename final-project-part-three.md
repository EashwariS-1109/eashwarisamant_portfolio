## Changes made since Part II
> After Part II, I spent the mmost time and energy in deciding what to eliminate from my story arc in order to make the core message more crisp, and to create that 'aha' moment for my intended audience where they get an at-a-glance insight about the dangers of in-home falls. This was a particularly intentional and frictional but it helped me think about the trade offs related to eliminating information. Below are a few signifcant changes that I made after Part II -
> 
> ### Modifying Act I of the narrative - Do they really need to know their spending power?  
> In Part II, I had decided to start off the story with a focus on making my audience (middle income GenX and Boomer homeowners) feel empowered (as opposed to aging and helpless). I wanted to show their contribution to the economy and their spending power to evoke this effect. However, my user research revealed that the audience felt a disconnect between this section and the further parts of the story.   
> ### Changing the split bar chart viz - How to visually show the healthcare cost of a fall?   
> In Part II, I had decided to do a split bar chart viz, with one side of the bar chart showing the cost of a type of home modification, and the other side showing the healthcare cost that may arise if that modification wasn't done. However, this was feeling like it was force fit into the narrative. The key question was - do audiences need to relate particular home mods with the costs? Or should the focus be just on creating awareness of the overall healthcare cost and how it can be avoided? User research showed that the split bar voz was confusing. For the final viz, I showed healthcare costs of a fall (from $40k to $7k) by taking inspiration from the one pixel wealth data viz. The spatial reduction of the square that represented the cost was ultimately very effective in bringing about an insightful moment for the audience.   
> ### Shifting the overall focus - Directing the audience to a specific service v/s creating awareness and giving a small 'nudge' as a CTA?   
> Based on the feedback gathered after Part II, I realized that directing the audience towards a home modification service is acting against the purpose of the story and making it lose its credibility. Therefore, I shifted my focus from using the story as a customer acquisition vehicle to an informational piece that aimed at creating awareness instead. 
   

## The audience  
> Part II helped me set my user persona in mind, before I refined my data story. I was more or less targeting the exact same persona and there wasn't much change in this part.
>
> 
> ### Proactive Planner  
> 45-55 years old, Middle income   
>
> Family: Likely has grown or nearly grown children, may also be caring for aging parents  
> 
> Home Ownership: Majority are homeowners, with properties that may be 20+ years old and in need of renovation or modification  
> 
> Motivations: As they approach retirement age, they are motivated by the desire to live comfortably in their homes for as long as possible. They are looking for ways to safeguard their health and independence while managing the financial aspect of home improvements on a budget.  
> 
> Pain Points: They are aware of the rising costs of healthcare and assisted living  
> 
> Barriers: While concerned about future risks, they may lack awareness of available home modifications or feel overwhelmed by the costs associated with such improvements. They may also be unsure about how to begin the process or who to trust for the work.

> However, I was intentional in my use of active and passive voice and the first/second person language in copywriting of the slides. For example, in the title slide, I used "Your Home, Your Future", as if I was directly talking to my intended audience. This made them look up and take notice. In the next 2 slides, I used a more indirect third person to show the home ownership rate and how homes are treasured possessions. But in Slide 3, I went back to a first person voice, writing " But what if YOUR home doesn't evolve to meet YOUR needs?" This helped in creating a strong emotional connect with the target user.
