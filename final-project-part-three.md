## Changes made since Part II
> After Part II, I spent the mmost time and energy in deciding what to eliminate from my story arc in order to make the core message more crisp, and to create that 'aha' moment for my intended audience where they get an at-a-glance insight about the dangers of in-home falls. This was a particularly intentional and frictional but it helped me think about the trade offs related to eliminating information. Below are a few signifcant changes that I made after Part II -
> 
> ### Modifying Act I of the narrative - Do they really need to know their spending power?  
> In Part II, I had decided to start off the story with a focus on making my audience (middle income GenX and Boomer homeowners) feel empowered (as opposed to aging and helpless). I wanted to show their contribution to the economy and their spending power to evoke this effect. However, my user research revealed that the audience felt a disconnect between this section and the further parts of the story.   
> ### Changing the split bar chart viz - How to visually show the healthcare cost of a fall?   
> In Part II, I had decided to do a split bar chart viz, with one side of the bar chart showing the cost of a type of home modification, and the other side showing the healthcare cost that may arise if that modification wasn't done. However, this was feeling like it was force fit into the narrative. The key question was - do audiences need to relate particular home mods with the costs? Or should the focus be just on creating awareness of the overall healthcare cost and how it can be avoided? User research showed that the split bar voz was confusing. For the final viz, I showed healthcare costs of a fall (from $40k to $7k) by taking inspiration from the one pixel wealth data viz. The spatial reduction of the square that represented the cost was ultimately very effective in bringing about an insightful moment for the audience.   
> ### Shifting the overall focus - Directing the audience to a specific service v/s creating awareness and giving a small 'nudge' as a CTA?   
> Based on the feedback gathered after Part II, I realized that directing the audience towards a home modification service is acting against the purpose of the story and making it lose its credibility. Therefore, I shifted my focus from using the story as a customer acquisition vehicle to an informational piece that aimed at creating awareness instead. 
   

## The audience  
> Part II helped me set my user persona in mind, before I refined my data story. I was more or less targeting the exact same persona and there wasn't much change in this part.
>
> 
> ### Proactive Planner  
> 45-55 years old, Middle income   
>
> Family: Likely has grown or nearly grown children, may also be caring for aging parents  
> 
> Home Ownership: Majority are homeowners, with properties that may be 20+ years old and in need of renovation or modification  
> 
> Motivations: As they approach retirement age, they are motivated by the desire to live comfortably in their homes for as long as possible. They are looking for ways to safeguard their health and independence while managing the financial aspect of home improvements on a budget.  
> 
> Pain Points: They are aware of the rising costs of healthcare and assisted living  
> 
> Barriers: While concerned about future risks, they may lack awareness of available home modifications or feel overwhelmed by the costs associated with such improvements. They may also be unsure about how to begin the process or who to trust for the work.

> However, I was intentional in my use of active and passive voice and the first/second person language in copywriting of the slides. For example, in the title slide, I used "Your Home, Your Future", as if I was directly talking to my intended audience. This made them look up and take notice. In the next 2 slides, I used a more indirect third person to show the home ownership rate and how homes are treasured possessions. But in Slide 3, I went back to a first person voice, writing " But what if YOUR home doesn't evolve to meet YOUR needs?" This helped in creating a strong emotional connect with the target user.   


## Final design decisions
> After the user research in Part II, I took the opportunity to revisit my design choices, not just in terms of the data viz form, but also its execution, medium and supporting visual language.
>
> ### Accessibility in Type, Color and Form
> It was important to center my design decisions around type, color and shape/form around accessibility, given the age group of my target audience. For type, I used the IBM Plex Sans family, but eliminated the use of the 'light' variant after user research revealed that it had low legibility. When it came to color and imagery, I wanted to evoke a sense of credibility, trust and convey the gravity of the topic. This is why I chose to limit my color palette to just blue, black and white. Balancing the use of black and white proportions and blue as an accent color gave me the control to evoke positive or negative emotions in the audience.

> ### Translating Data Vizs from Tableau to Figma
> Although I created all my visualizations in Tableau, I decided to trace/redo those in Figma in order to enhance their comprehension. Particularly in the case of the line chart, this decision proved to be useful because I could use a subtle monochrome gradation in the line chart, to effectively convey the meaning. Likewise, I made the last healthcare cost 'treemap' viz in Figma to control the size of the square as it had to accurately relate to the amount of dollars spent on healthcare.
> 
> ### When in doubt, simply subtract
> Throughout the data story, I tried to eliminate as much as I could. This may sound counterintuitive but my secondary research showed that my target demographic spends not more than 30 seconds scrolling through something like this. Also, eliminating walls of text and unneccessary details helped me bring about a sense of focus and clarity about the exact message I wanted to convey through my story. As a consequence, it also became really easy to present my whole story withina  minute during the in class presentation. This was probably the most important design decision that helped me create a strong narrative.
> 
> ### Sensitivity of imagery
> I made a conscious decision to not show any explicit/direct or off putting imagery. Given the demographic of my target audience, it would've been counterintuitive to show images of seniors falling, being hospitalized or suffering from a serious injury. This was not discovered during user research, but rather something that came from my designer instincts and experience. An example of this would be the slide where I used an image of a broken plate to signify at-home falls. Another example is the slide where I showed 1 in 4 older adults in the US reported falling each year. There, I tilted and blurred one blue rectangle, and kept the other three white rectabgles sharply in focus. When the reader scrolls through the shorthand, it is automatically conveyed that the blue out-of-focus rectangle has 'fallen'. Visuals like these helped in maintaining the strong connect with the gravity of the topic, without resorting to explicit or sensitive imagery. If that was the case, the data story would sound like it was fear mongering instead of creating awareness.

# Final thoughts
> This project helped me evolve as a designer. With the skills I learned in crafting a data story, I'm confident that I can present to C-Suite or senior management in my future role as a design strategist. Considering that my target domains for a job are healthcare, education, gov-tech and finance, this skill becomes especially important given the serious impact the products/services can have on the end user. I will use this skill to convey research insights, streamline and steer decision making in the right direction and ultimately build products that benefit the business and the user. I think the learnings from this project blend really well with my past skillset of visual design and stroytelling (film making). If I had more time with this project, I would explore Tableau in depth and come up with advanced interactive and animated data vizs that the audience could actively engage with. However, if that was the case, I would free the story from the restraints of Shorthand, and instead embed it in a place like a website landing page or a social media insert/ad. This would also help in lead generation and conversion.
