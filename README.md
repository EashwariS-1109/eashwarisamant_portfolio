# Eashwari Samant's Data Visualization Portfolio
Hello! This is my public portfolio for the course Telling Stories with Data! :)

# About Me
I'm Eashwari, from the MIIPS-Advanced Study program at CMU. 
Iâ€™m a design strategist and visual storyteller with 3+ years of experience in working with digital product innovation teams. I use human-centered design principles and practices to uncover unmet user needs and craft strategic product visions. Most recently, I worked as a design and strategy intern at Omicelo Investments, a private investment group in Pittsburgh. 

I'm passionate about - Chai, dogs, and using fonts that have good kerning.

# What I Hope to Learn
In this class I'm eager to build my expertise in blending visual design, data analysis and business acumen to influence strategic decisions. Given my recent experience of working at a private investment group, I think this skill will differentiate me as a business-savvy designer, who can communicate impactful business opportunities through data. I'm also excited to revisit and polish some basics from my academic design background, such as color theory, typography and layout.

# Projects
## [Visualizing Government Debt](/govtdebt.md)
General government debt is the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP.
Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories where applicable: currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. A key indicator for the sustainability of government finance, changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits. This indicator is measured as a percentage of GDP.

## [Exploring the Relationship between GDP and Child Mortality](/childmortality.md)
This project uses the critique by design method to revamp an existing data viz presented by 'Our World in Data'.

Project Summary 
By the year 2054, 23% of the US population will be over 65 years of age. For a group of people that are moving fast towards becoming young seniors*, there's still a lack of awareness and proactiveness about safeguarding their own independence. In this project, we explore the long term value a holistic home modification can bring, creating sustained physical independence and saving people thousands of dollars - and potentially their life.
