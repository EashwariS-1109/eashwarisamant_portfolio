# Final Project Part I

## Project Outline
By 2023, 23% of the U.S. population will be over 65, representing a rapidly growing demographic approaching the challenges of aging. For this group, there remains a surprising lack of awareness and proactiveness in safeguarding their long-term independence, especially through home modifications. This project explores the significant, long-term value of holistic home modifications, which can help seniors maintain physical autonomy, reduce the risk of injury, and avoid the high costs associated with assisted living or healthcare.         
We will evaluate various home modification strategies, such as installing ramps, widening doorways, enhancing bathroom safety, and integrating smart home technologies. we aim to demonstrate how these adjustments not only provide immediate safety benefits but also result in substantial cost savings over time. Ultimately, the project will offer a roadmap for those approaching senior status to take proactive steps, ensuring a safer, more independent lifestyle while potentially saving thousands of dollars—and even their lives.

The intent is to use this story as a targeted marketing piece for a specific home modification business in Southwest PA. It may later be plugged into the website of that business, so the visual language and tone of voice will be curated in keeping with that touchpoint. The intended audience for this is low to middle income, 45-55 year old US citizens who are towards the end of their professional career. 

Here's an example archetype of the audience.
